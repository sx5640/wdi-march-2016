# How To Think Like A Developer

## Approaches to software development

## User Stories

As a user...
I should be able to...
So that...

As a user, I should be able to add a picture (of their face!)
As a user, I should be able to sort my contacts
As a user, I should be able to personalize each contact
As a user, I should be able to track the contact history
As a user, I should be able to share the contacts
As a user, I should be able to mark contacts as favourites
As a user, I should be able to back up my contacts







## Prioritize

- MUST HAVE
As a user, I should be able to create a contact
As a user, I should be able to store their phone number and email
As a user, I should be able to search through the contacts
As a user, I should be able to update a contact
As a user, I should be able to delete a contact
As a user, I should be able to display all my contacts

- SHOULD HAVE
As a user, I should be able to filter the contacts

- COULD HAVE
As a user, I should be able to call the contact
As a user, I should be able to group the contacts

- WON'T HAVE





## Define Objects in our system

- Once you're more familiar with the process of planning a system this step will come early on
- Today, we'll start writing code and iteratively move toward an object-oriented system







## CRM User Stories

- As a user, I am presented with a prompt to 'add', 'modify', 'display all', 'display contact', display attribute', 'delete' and 'exit'.

- As a user, if 1 is typed, I am prompted to give my 'first name', 'last name', 'email' and 'notes'.

- As a user, if 2 is typed, I am prompted to enter a contact attribute to be modified.

- As a user, when an attribute is entered, I am prompted to type 'yes' or 'no' to confirm my selection.

- As a user, if 'yes' is typed, I am prompted to change 'id', 'firstname', 'lastname' and 'email'.

- As a user, when an attribute is entered, I am prompted to enter a new value for the attribute.

- As a user, if 'no' is typed, I am returned back to the main menu.

- As a user, if 'display all' is typed, I am shown all of the contacts that exist.

- As a user, if 'display contact' is typed, I am shown a particular contact.

- As a user, if 'display attribute' is typed, I am prompted to enter an attribute so that I can see all of the contacts according to that attribute.

- As a user, if 'delete' is typed, I am prompted to enter an attribute value of the contact to be deleted.

- As a user, if 'exit' is typed, I am exited out of the program and returned to the command line.
