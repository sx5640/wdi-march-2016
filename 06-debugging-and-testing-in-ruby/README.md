## Debugging

### Good habits for avoiding bugs
- proper indentation
- using meaningful names for variables, methods, classes
- run the code frequently
- comment your code
- keep it simple
- each method and class should have one responsibility
- pair programming!
- don't use really similar names
- take breaks!
- don't repeat yourself (DRY)




### Debugging techniques
- use a debugger to set breakpoints
- read the error message (all of it!)
- line number of error
- stack trace
- print values out to the screen
- refactor or simplify your code
- process of elimination: comment out parts of code
- write tests
- try different inputs (literal values instead of variables)
- ask for help
- rubber duck debugging
- stack overflow or google
- read the docs
- variable inspection (debugger)
- read the code
