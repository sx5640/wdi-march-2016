# Crowdfunder & Multi-model Forms

This week there's only one assignment: Crowdfunder. There's no tutorial or repo to work with, you'll be forming teams and figuring out which stories to work on to get the app working by the end of the week.

## Agenda
After this lesson, you'll know:

  * How to approach the Crowdfunder project
  * When you would need to save multiple models from the same form
  * How to set up a multi-model form
